# No Strongboxes
Make strongbox drops invisible and automatically discards any strongboxes from your inventory.

### Chat commands:
* **!NoStrongboxes** - Toggles the module off/on

Command is not case-sensitive. [slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) is supported but not required

### Info:
* Strongbox drops will be invisible for you, but they will still exist on the server. So if you're in a party or have a loot-pet, it can still be looted. If you do happen to get a strongbox, it will automatically be deleted from your inventory.
